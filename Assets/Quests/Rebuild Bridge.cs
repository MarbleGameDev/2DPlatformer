		//He will tell you that there shipment of wood has not come in and the caravan taking the shipment disapeared.
		//He wants you to bring him some wood forestry shop nearby. (note: he wanted to get the caravan over the forestry shop because he fucking hates that dude and wants you to do it so he doesnt get embarresed.)
		//You go to the foresters shop and you do (place something cool here) and then you get four bundles of high quality wood.
		// bring the wood back and they will work until midnight
		// this teaches you how to talk to people as well as how timing works and it will allow you to get other events that happen only at night. 
		// 101/10 memes

		// later in the game there is going to be a "dungeon" here.
