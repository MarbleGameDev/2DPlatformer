//First step of the quest is talking to a carpenter right next to the destroyed bridge
//The carpenter says that his stache of wooden resources hasnt arived yet and that you will have to talk to the forestry guy.
//He wants you to bring him some wood forestry shop nearby. (note: he wanted to get the caravan over the forestry shop because he fucking hates that dude and wants you to do it so he doesnt get embarresed.)
//You go to the foresters shop and you do (place something cool here) and then you get four bundles of high quality wood.
// bring the wood back and they will work until midnight
